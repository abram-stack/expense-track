# expense-tracker

Purpose of this mini project is to use react form and be able to submit.
I use the analogy of creating an expense tracker.


This mini project is based on React 18 and several react hook are used.
For isntance, react useState(), useForm() are used. 

for installing useForm:
npm i react-hook-form@7.43

for the validation, Zod is used
npm i zod@3.20.6

to integrate zod with react form, resolvers and infer are used:
npm i @hookform/resolvers@2.9.11
